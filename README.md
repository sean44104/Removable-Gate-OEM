Removable Gate OEM is a project [based on my previous work](https://github.com/sean44104/Removable-Gate-GCC) designed to bring the removable gate system to OEM Gamecube Controller shells in the form of a small DIY kit

This release contains STL, STEP, and F3D files for each part of the project. The STLs are high resolution and ready to be resin printed. You can import the F3D file into fusion360, or the STEP files into any other CAD program you like to make changes to the design as you see fit! The files feature 5 unique gateplate designs, each with their own different number of notches for you to experiment with. Additionally, the files also include what I call a **ThreadHolder** and a **DrillJig**. The ThreadHolder is a piece that will slide under the control stick area of the GCC front shell. It has slots inside that will hold the metal threads permanently inside of the shell. When you put a gateplate onto the front of your controller, the gateplate will screw into these threads and hold it firmly in place!

This project requires modification of the OEM Gamecube Controller front shell in order to fit and function. A section of the shell first needs to be removed, and then 3 holes need to be drilled into the shell. These holes require a 3/16 inch drill bit. The DrillJig is a piece that slides under the control stick area of the GCC, just like the ThreadHolder, and shows you exactly where to drill so that you can put the drill holes in the exact perfect spot. After you are done drilling, the DrillJig is to be removed from the controller and replaced by the ThreadHolder, the permanent piece that goes in that spot for the mod to work. You can reuse the DrillJig to drill holes in multiple controller shells. **Use the DrillJig after removing the gate area of the front shell and before installing the ThreadHolder!**
