# Removable-Gate-OEM

Removable Gate OEM is a project [based on my previous work](https://github.com/sean44104/Removable-Gate-GCC) designed to bring the removable gate system to OEM Gamecube Controller shells in the form of a small DIY kit

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sean44104/Removable-Gate-OEM/main/Images/image1.PNG)

This release contains STL, STEP, and F3D files for each part of the project. The STLs are high resolution and ready to be resin printed. You can import the F3D file into fusion360, or the STEP files into any other CAD program you like to make changes to the design as you see fit! The files feature 5 unique gateplate designs, each with their own different number of notches for you to experiment with. Additionally, the files also include what I call a **ThreadHolder** and a **DrillJig**. The ThreadHolder is a piece that will slide under the control stick area of the GCC front shell. It has slots inside that will hold the metal threads permanently inside of the shell. When you put a gateplate onto the front of your controller, the gateplate will screw into these threads and hold it firmly in place!

This project requires modification of the OEM Gamecube Controller front shell in order to fit and function. A section of the shell first needs to be removed, and then 3 holes need to be drilled into the shell. These holes require a 3/16 inch drill bit. The DrillJig is a piece that slides under the control stick area of the GCC, just like the ThreadHolder, and shows you exactly where to drill so that you can put the drill holes in the exact perfect spot. After you are done drilling, the DrillJig is to be removed from the controller and replaced by the ThreadHolder, the permanent piece that goes in that spot for the mod to work. You can reuse the DrillJig to drill holes in multiple controller shells. **Use the DrillJig after removing the gate area of the front shell and before installing the ThreadHolder!**

# Removable Gate OEM Installation Tutorial:

# Step 1
The first thing you need to do is remove the gate material from the front shell. Remove the entire lifted circular section of the control stick gate, shown here in green. Cut off the entire lifted dome until it is flat with the rest of the front shell's surface. You can use a dremel to cut it off and then sand down the excess. Do not go deep into the shell, remove any of the inside, or take out the cylinder that extends down into the shell. Here is a front and side profile of what is to be removed:

**Your shell should look like this after you are finished**

# Step 2
Next, you are going to use the DrillJig. Slide the jig into the back of the front shell so that the curved side is going down into the controller and the flat side is facing up as shown. Now, use a 3/16 inch drill bit to remove the material shown here in green:

Once you are finished drilling it should look like this:

# Step 3
Now, you are going to install the ThreadHolder. Remove the DrillJig from the controller shell and apply a small amount of glue to the flat top surface of the ThreadHolder. Then, you are going to slide it into the back of the front shell, just like the DrillJig, shown here:
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sean44104/Removable-Gate-OEM/main/Images/t9.png)
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sean44104/Removable-Gate-OEM/main/Images/t9b.png)

Make sure to firmly press the ThreadHolder in and push it down so that the entire piece makes good contact with the back of the controller front shell

# Step 4
Take your [thread pieces](https://www.mcmaster.com/90363a110/) and push them into the containers of the ThreadHolder until they are all the way in, as shown. This may be a tight friction fit, so you can use a screwdriver to push them in by applying pressure to the center of the thread piece.

These thread pieces are designed to expand out when [the screw](https://www.mcmaster.com/90236A105/) is threaded inside of them, embedding themselves into the ThreadHolder and locking them inside of there permanently. I recommend that for the first time, you put the screws in upside down like so. This way the threads can be expanded securely and will not fall out.

# Step 5
You are basically done now! Remove the upside-down screws from their thread pieces. The front shell is complete. You can now take a Gateplate and place it onto the front face of your Gamecube Controller front shell. It has three pegs underneath it, which will slot nicely into the holes that you drilled. Now, just insert a screw into each of the three holes on the gateplate surface and they will go through the gateplate, through the front shell, and thread into the metal inserts inside of the ThreadHolder. It will look like this when you are done and everything is fully installed:

Now, you can assemble your controller. You will be able to remove and attach gateplates onto your controller while it is fully assembled. You do not have to take the controller apart whatsoever to remove or swap out a gateplate. Simply unscrew the Gateplate, remove the screws, and pull the Gateplate out. The internal parts will stay in place and not fall out!
